CargoCloud is a customized Integrated Logistics Platform & Carrier Database GUI under development. Allows for the integration of various Logistics platforms for quicker and more seamless data aggregation. 

Currently the flagship feature of this application is the CarrierCloud Database.

  Easily search and find carriers in the database
    Search by zip allows you to put in a zip code and range and find any stored carrier's within that radius (up to 625 miles)
